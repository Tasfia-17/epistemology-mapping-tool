# Technical Architecture

## System Overview
This architecture is designed for rapid implementation while maintaining scalability, using proven technologies with minimal dependencies.

## Core Components

### Backend Services
- FastAPI server for real-time epistemology tagging
- Regex-based pattern matching for epistemology detection
- Whisper integration for audio processing
- Rule-based epistemology classification
- RESTful API endpoints for text and audio input

### Frontend Visualization
- Single HTML file with vanilla JavaScript and D3.js for interactive graphs
- Responsive design for multiple device support
- Color-coded epistemology node system
- Interactive force-directed graphs

### Data Flow
1. User inputs text or audio via web interface
2. Audio processed through Whisper transcription
3. Text analyzed by regex-based epistemology classifier
4. Results formatted as epistemological triples
5. Visualization engine renders interactive map

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Whisper
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, D3.js
- **AI/ML**: Symbolic AI rules, pattern matching
- **Deployment**: Local development
