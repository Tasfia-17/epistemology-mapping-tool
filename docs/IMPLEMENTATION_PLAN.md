# Implementation Plan

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Epistemology framework finalization
- Example data collection and processing
- Regex pattern development
- Basic pattern matching implementation
- Test dataset creation

### Phase 2: Core Development
- Backend API implementation
- Frontend visualization
- Integration testing
- Real-time data flow setup
- Basic user interface

### Phase 3: Polish
- User experience refinement
- Performance optimization
- Documentation and deployment
- Demo preparation
- Final testing and bug fixes

## Success Metrics
- Real-time tagging under 200ms response
- Accurate epistemology classification
- Intuitive visual representation
- Smooth demo execution
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with text-only processing
- Use simple D3 visualization initially
- Focus on 4 core epistemology tags first
- Implement audio processing as stretch goal
- Have fallback visualization options

## Quality Assurance
- Unit tests for epistemology classification
- Integration tests for data flow
- User testing for interface clarity
- Performance testing for real-time requirements
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
